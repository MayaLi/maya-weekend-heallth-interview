## problem statement

Implement a function named **`findWords`** that accepts two arguments: 1) an input string and 2) a dictionary. This function should return an array of words from the dictionary that can be formed by rearranging some or all of the letters in the input string. Each letter in the input string may be used up to once per word.

## Function signature:

```
function findWords(inputString: string, dictionary:string[]): string[]
```

## Local environment setup

Install a package manager like [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) (highly recommended).

Install [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and install something relatively recent. Make sure that you have `npx`. Herre is what my environment dependencies look like:

```
node -v
v22.1.0

npx -v
10.7.0
```

1. On your local machine, open up a terminal. Download the code to your code directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:MayaLi/maya-weekend-heallth-interview.git
```

2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`. You should see a new `npm_modules` folder with dependency packages
